# Write All Night

Write all night is an application designed to provide writers a web platform to store their stories and see data about their writing as they progress through their stories.  

Write All Night was built with Angular, Node, Express and PostgreSQL.  I also used libraries such as Chart JS, TextAngular and Moment JS.
